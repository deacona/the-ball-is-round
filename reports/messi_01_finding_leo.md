# Messi event data

Computational notebook for this analysis can be found [here](../notebooks/messi_01_finding_leo.ipynb)


## Problem

Where does Lionel Messi take his shots from? Can we see any patterns? Does he differ from the average player?


## Plan

I wanted to look at
* General trends over time
* Plots of start and end shot locations
  * Shot volume
  * Shot efficiency (goals per shots)
  * Hot spots (goals minus expected goals)


## Data

We have compiled 16 seasons of data on 485 matches played by Lionel Messi for Barcelona in La Liga.


## Analysis



## Conclusions
